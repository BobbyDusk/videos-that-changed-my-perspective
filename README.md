# Videos that changed my perspective
- [https://youtu.be/HBluLfX2F_k?si=OFWQNQSpeUbrdovz](Veritasium video about distributions in different environments. Very intersting, especially how in some situations you get the most benefit from being consistent and in other situations you benefit most from experimenting a lot.)
- [https://youtu.be/NfMdvee5HoY?si=xwufydBp7DCJaNmg](Johnny Harris video showing the lifestyle of different wealth brackets. It's very interesting to see the contrast between the richest and the poorest and what the richest do to gain even more wealth)
- [https://youtu.be/PpyPB3BF-hQ?si=xhtPz8kRJXHcM_pq](Continuation of the previous video where he also shows the lifestyle of the very richests. It is interesting to see how they avoid paying taxes and buy influence.)
- [https://youtu.be/mScpHTIi-kM?si=jMIFvyzLpUqHnxPQ](Veritasium video showing that working together with others, until they screw you over, is always the best strategy)
